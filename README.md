# spring-boot-otel-context-propagation
## Introduction
In my previous [spring-boot-otel-jaeger](https://github.com/santipabWannakiri/spring-boot-otel-jaeger) POC project, I utilized Spring Boot with OpenTelemetry, incorporating the configuration of the Otel Collector and Jaeger dashboards. This project provides a comprehensive overview of the advantages of adopting OpenTelemetry, particularly in the realm of tracing. While it successfully establishes the foundation for understanding OpenTelemetry, there is still a crucial core concept that requires attention â€“ `Context Propagation`. Consequently, my focus for this POC project will be on the seamless setup of the end-to-end project, followed by a demonstration of how context propagation operates and its impact on the overall results.
